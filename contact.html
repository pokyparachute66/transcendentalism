       <div class="sec-2-img-info center">Self-Reliance is a main feature of transcendentalism. Transcendentalists believed that people should not follow the paths of other people, but trust themselves. They believed that people should be free thinkers and fend for themselves in the world. By being self-reliant and accepting their thoughts and feelings, Transcendentalists believe people could develop personally and become a greater person than they were before. By being self-reliant, people become more independent and develop more confidence.</div>

       <div class="sec-3-heading center">Examples in Today's World</div>
       
       <div class="sec-3-info center ">Self-Reliance is an extremely prevalent ideal in today's world. It is popular in things such as movies or daily life. Self-Reliance is a huge theme in many movies today. For example, Hunger Games is a movie where you must do everything yourself to survive. There is no one in the arena to help you, only kill you, so you must rely on yourself to gather materials and survive. This sort of theme is also present in many other movies today. Self-Reliance is also a key thing in the real world. If you lose family members, or move away from family, it is up to you to fend for yourself. You must rely on yourself to make money, find a place to live, and still get all the food/water you need. Overall, Self-Reliance is a huge theme in the world today.</div>

       <div class="sec-4-heading center">Comparison of Literature.</div>
       
       <div class="sec-4-info center ">Self-reliance was written about in different pieces of transcendentalist literature. <i>Self-Reliance</i>, by Ralph Waldo Emerson is a clear example of this. This story is written to directly address self-reliance and what it means. In <i>Self-Reliance</i>, Ralph says "..no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground." Ralph is trying to convince readers not to rely on others, but to rely on yourself. We also see themes of self reliance is modern literature today. The book Hatchet is about a boy who is stuck in the woods with only a hatchet. There is no one else with him, so he must rely on himself to survive. This book does a superb job at representing the feature of self-reliance, which is a big feature of transcendentalism.</div>
