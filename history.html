       <div class="sec-2-img-info center">Confidence is the ability to believe in yourself and be sure of any action that you take. Confidence is a key feature of transcendentalism. By having confidence in everything you do, you are able to excel as a person. Confidence allows you to better yourself by giving you the extra drive to complete tasks or answer questions. You are able to focus on bettering yourself and everyone around you. In stories such as <i>Civil Disobedience</i>, it was confident that allowed and pushed Henry to write his letter that he used to express his ideas and beliefs. Transcendentalists believe that confidence is a key characteristic of every person and a very important thing to develop.</div>

       <div class="sec-3-info center ">Confidence a huge thing in the modern day world. Although, the aim of confidence has shifted. Nowadays, confidence is more and more associated with body image and fitting in, compared to right answers. We have seen public displays of confidence thought famous figures such as Lady Gaga. For a time, Lady Gaga was known for her absurd dresses. She would show up to events in bizarre apparel. For her, this was a display a confidence. Many people would never wear these weird dresses in public, but by seeing a famous figure wear them confidently, it resonated with them and in result, boosted their confidence.</div>

       <div class="sec-4-heading center">Comparison of Literature.</div>
       <div class="sec-4-info center">We do not see as many writings about confidence today as we did in the 19th century. As a feature of Transcendentalism, confidence was often written about in stories. A story that shows the trait of confidence is <i>Self-Reliance</i>, by Ralph Waldo Emerson. This story displays confidence due to the amount of confidence you need to rely on yourself to survive or complete a task. Without the confidence needed to complete the task, it will be much more difficult to complete. We don't see many stories written about confidence anymore. You can make the argument that every survival story has an underlying theme of confidence, but I believe it focuses more on self-reliance than actual confidence.
