       <div class="sec-2-img-info center">Non-conformity is a key feature of transcendentalism. This feature is shown in the writings of many transcendentalists. A quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson says, "Do not follow where the path may lead. Go, instead, where there is no path and leave a trail". Ralph is expressing a very powerful message about non-conformity through this quote. What he is saying is that you should make your own paths, and not follow what other people do. Transcendentalists believe that you shouldn't conform to a set rules and ideals, but create your own instead. They believe that people should be outgoing and not afraid to do what they believe in.</div>

       <div class="sec-3-heading center">Examples in Today's World</div>
       
       <div class="sec-3-info center ">There are many examples of Non-Conformity in today's world. Some examples being The Incredibles movie or singers like Miley Cyrus. First off, The Incredibles represents non-conformity because they go against what the rest of the world is like. They have super powers, therefore, they try to stop the bad guys. The rest of the world does not have these powers, so that is what really sets them apart. In the real world, Miley Cyrus is also an example of non-conformity. Over the past years, she has created songs and dressed in ways that do not conform to what the public considers normal. She went against these standards and set herself apart from other musicians in the music industry.</div>

       <div class="sec-4-heading center">Comparison of Literature.</div>
       
       <div class="sec-4-info center ">Literature in the 19th century is drastically different than what we have today. Some very famous transcendentalist pieces of literature were works such as <i>Civil Disobedience</i> and <i>Self-Reliance</i>. These two works are similar in expressing ideals of Non-conformity. They both talk about going against set paths and creating your own path instead. There are many pieces of modern day literature that also reflect these ideals. Non-conformity is a very prominent topic in many stories in today's world. In stories such as the Divergent book series, you have a main character that does not fit into the rest of society. Due to this, she does not follow the rules that are set in place and instead creates her own path.</div>
