       <div class="sec-2-img-info center">Nature is a very important aspect of life to transcendentalists. They believed nature was a very powerful thing that you could use to better yourself. They believed that it was a way to relax and better your religious faith. Nature is a such a relaxing and peaceful place. Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote <i>Nature</i>, believe that taking time for yourself surrounded by nature can have many positive impacts on both your mind and body. The beauty of nature is unmatchable and they believe it should be protected from abuse.</div>

       <div class="sec-3-info center ">The importance of nature is a very important thing in the modern world. We see it used in many different ways. People enjoy doing activities in nature such as biking, hiking, walking, upon many other activities. These activities are often viewed as ways to relax and connect with the world around you, which are features of transcendentalism. We also see efforts to preserve our environment and protect nature through environmental agencies. Littering and pollution are a huge problems in our world. Due to this, there are programs in place to help reduce the amount of pollution and destruction of the environment. Trancendentalists would agree with this approach due to how much they value the beauty of nature and the environment.</div>

       <div class="sec-4-heading center">Comparison of Literature.</div>
       
       <div class="sec-4-info center ">Trancendentalists focused a lot of their writings around nature. An example of this is <i>Nature</i>, by Ralph Waldo Emerson. In <i>Nature</i>, Ralph talks about all of the wonderful things nature has to offer and what it can do for a person. For example, in the story he states "In the woods, we return to reason and faith." This quote does a very good job at summarizing what transcendentalists believe nature can do. They believe that nature clears your mind and allows you to put your best foot forwards. We also see Nature play a huge role in <i>Walden</i>, by Henry David Thoreau. In this story, Henry immerses himself in nature and talks about the marvelous and beautiful aspects of it.</div>
