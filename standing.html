       <div class="sec-2-img-info center">Standing up peacefully to a ruling force is an important theme of Transcendentalism. It shows up in many different pieces of Transcendentalist stories such as <i>Civil Disobedience</i>, by Henry David Thoreau. Instead of going straight to violence, transcendentalists choose the peaceful way and want to handle things in a calm manner. This reflects on their personality as a more calm minded person who choose to live life simply.</div>

       <div class="sec-3-heading center">Examples in Today's World</div>
       
       <div class="sec-3-info center ">The ideal of standing up peacefully to a ruling force can be connected to many events that took place in history. A prime example of this was during the lifetime of Martin Luther King Jr. MLK advocated for black rights through only peaceful protests. He was standing up to the government and racist people in a peaceful manner. As an aspect of transcendentalism, MLK stood up to a ruling force peacefully to advocate and push for what he thought was right. These events fit hand in hand with the transcendentalist feature of standing up peacefully to a ruling force.</div>

       <div class="sec-4-heading center">Comparison of Literature.</div>
       
       <div class="sec-4-info center ">Features of standing up peacefully to a ruling force are present in works throughout history. First off, the Declaration of Independence was an attempt to stand up to a ruling force peacefully. The American colonists did not want to be ruled by the British anymore, so they issued the Declaration of Independence which was a written document that allowed the colonists to stand up to a ruling force, the British. The intention was for a peaceful negotiation, although, it didn't end that way. Secondly, Henry David Thoreau's <i>Civil Disobedience</i> is about standing up to a ruling force. He uses literature to express his discontent with the government and peacefully oppose what they were doing.</div>
