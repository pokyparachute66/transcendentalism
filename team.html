       <div class="sec-2-img-info center">Free thought is an important characteristic of transcendentalism. Free thought is the ability to think and express whatever you would like. Free thought should be as it seems, free. Some people do not support this claim. Governments and people around the world believe that free thought should be regulated and restrictions should be put in place. Trancendentalists do not share this belief. Though stories such as <i>Civil Disobedience</i>, it is shown that free thought is an extremely important right and a key feature to Transcendentalism.</div>
